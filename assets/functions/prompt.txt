Turn the following yaml into a fitting functions json for you to handle later.
Don't say anything, just generate the json. For context, your JSON may look as follows.
Take a good look at what are possible keys and what key is where.
Make sure there is no kafka-topic in the function object.
Generate missing keys depending on context.
The required is always at the root of parameters and a list of key names.
Do not include it inside the paramertes.
Set the function name to the kafka topic value.
Try to add a fitting description to each property considering the current context of the function object.
Use fitting types for the properties.
